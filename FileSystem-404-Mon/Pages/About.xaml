            FileSystem 404 Monitor - Ed Elliott ed@agilesql.club
           
            Wrote this because I sometimes get errors about files not being found or something similar and the app not showing what the name of the file is or what folder 
            it should be in. I find that I can use process monitor (procmon) but constantly in windows apps look for files that don't exist in each of the search paths but then
            work find because the file was found in a different directory.
            
            What this does is to only show files which have not had a success operation against them, that is all - most of the time this is completely useless but when you need to
            find a file when it isn't found or you get an access denied or some other error then this tool if for you!
